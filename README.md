# simple-openal-projects

i wanted a cross-platform audio library i could work with for projects that
involved audio. OpenAL seemed like a decent option for what i was interested
in, but it's not as well-documented as its more well-known and widely-used
older sibling OpenGL, which it is styled after. having used neither before, i
wanted to learn more and in the process i wrote some C snippets in the hopes of
better understanding the library.

that code can be found in the `src/` directory. each file has some extra info
in a footer at the bottom. this footer contains instructions on how to build
each file individually, but i've also included my best attempt at a Makefile
that just builds everything and puts the resulting files in `build/`.
